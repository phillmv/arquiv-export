#gitsync 

last time i got basic sync working:

- can pull, and resolve conflicts

but they're not run automatically and not yet tied together, i.e.

- doesn't auto push on a background job
- doesn't auto pull on a background job
- does it auto resolve?
- needs to have the remote be configurable
- lots of clean up around instantiating a new repo

and look at that the boy is awake!
