#gitsync 

ended up doing a lot of refactoring to the Importer, Exporter and LocalSyncer.

An intuition I had: that maybe these classes should be renamed.

The Exporter really is…………… `SyncDatabaseToDisk` or `SyncWithDisk` and the Importer really is `SyncDiskToDatabase` or `SyncWithDatabase`. The LocalSyncer is a `SyncWithGit` which in turn uses a `GitAdapter`.

Maybe! Something like that. But then it becomes clear that the SyncWithGit has to call SyncWithDisk and then the GitAdapter etc.
